# CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS

The if statement try to convert all the expressions inside of it to
true or false values
When it gets another result which not returns true or false
The language itself try to convert the value to true or false

So the Javascript has a list of Falsy values, which means the
values that he considers to be false in conditional statements as below:

```js
0 -0 NaN
""
undefined
false
null
```
