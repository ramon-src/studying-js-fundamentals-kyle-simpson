# VARIABLES AND BLOCKS

It's important to explicity declare our variables to make the code more readable
and to know where the things are.

Without declare a variable with var, let, const the javascript hoinsting the variables to the top of the application.

```js
var b = 42;
let c = 52;
const j = 62;

function a() {}
```

The function declaration means that we are setting a function inside the "a" variable
